# News-Scrape

# This application uses Cheerio to scrape NBC news and save results in MongoDB via Mongoose.

# Once a user opens the application, a scrape is immediately done and articles are displayed with their title and a link to the NBC article.

# A button also appears with each article giving the user an option to write a note associated with that article.

# Relations between collections have been created to associate the notes with their respective article, allowing them to appear when the "write note" button is clicked.

# Users can also delete notes from the database. A delete button will appear below each note.
